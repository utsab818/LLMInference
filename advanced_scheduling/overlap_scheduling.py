Overlap Scheduling

Goal: Hide latency by overlapping operations on different resources

Key insight: GPU has multiple independent units
  - Compute SMs (tensor cores, CUDA cores)
  - Copy engines (DMA for CPU<->GPU transfers)
  - Memory controllers

Operations that can overlap:
  1. Compute and H2D transfer (next batch input)
  2. Compute and D2H transfer (previous batch output)
  3. Compute and NVLink/PCIe communication
  4. Multiple copy operations on different engines

Implementation with CUDA streams:
  - Default stream: compute operations
  - Transfer stream: memory copies
  - Use events to synchronize when needed

For LLM inference:
  - While computing current batch, prefetch KV cache blocks
  - While generating, transfer outputs to CPU
  - Overlap all-reduce with independent computation

Double/triple buffering:
  - Buffer A: currently processing
  - Buffer B: being filled (prefetch)
  - Buffer C: results being transferred out

Benefits:
  - Hide memory transfer latency
  - Better GPU utilization
  - Lower effective latency
